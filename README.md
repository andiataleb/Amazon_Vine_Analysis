# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

##Overview
In this project, I worked on analyzing Amazon reviews written by the members of a paid program called Amazon Vine. The purpose of this analysis is to determine if paid reviewers are more likely and more biased to give a 5-satr review to the products compared to non paid reviewers. 
Some companies pay a small fee to Amazon to send their products to the members of this group to write a review for their products.
PySpark was used to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Then, by using the PySpark, the bias toward 5-star reviews form the Vine member groups was determined.
